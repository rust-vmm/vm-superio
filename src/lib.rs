//! Emulation for legacy devices.

//! For now, it offers emulation support only for the Linux serial console
//! and an i8042 PS/2 controller that only handles the CPU reset.
//!
//! It also provides a [Trigger](trait.Trigger.html) interface for an object
//! that can generate an event.

/// The user has to provide a `Trigger` object to the device's constructor when
/// initializing that device. The generic type `T: Trigger` is used in the
/// device's structure definition to mark the fact that the events notification
/// mechanism is done via the Trigger interface.
/// An example of how to implement the `Trigger` interface for
/// [an eventfd wrapper](https://docs.rs/vmm-sys-util/latest/vmm_sys_util/eventfd/index.html)
/// can be found in the
/// [`Example` section from `Serial`](../vm_superio/serial/struct.Serial.html#example).
/// The `EventFd` is wrapped in the `EventFdTrigger` newtype because Rust
/// doesn't allow implementing an external trait on external types. To get
/// around this restriction, the newtype pattern can be used. More details
/// about this,
